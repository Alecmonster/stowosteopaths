		<h2 class="subtitle">What is Osteopathy?</h2>
		<p class="answers">Osteopathy is a safe and natural therapy, which focuses on the framework of the body consisting of the bones, ligaments, muscles and connective tissues, which support the ‘soft bits’ inside that keep you alive. <br><br> Osteopaths assess the condition of this musculo-skeletal supporting system looking for areas of weakness, imbalance and excessive strain. Any potential ‘weak points’ will determine how well the body functions and they will have an influence on the general health of the whole body.</p>


		<h2 class="subtitle">How can I benefit from Osteopathy?</h2>
		<p class="answers">Osteopaths have become well known for treating people with back and neck problems because they are so good at it, however, many other problems can be treated very successfully with osteopathy. <br><br> Osteopathic treatment aimed at improving the mechanics of the body automatically influences such things as blood and nerve supply as well as activity of the internal organs. It is because of this that osteopathy, as well as treating people with the more obvious headaches, joint problems, sports injuries and postural strains, can also be used in the treatment of adults, children and babies with less obvious conditions such as asthma, digestive disorders, menstrual problems, chronic fatigue syndrome and a number of infant and childhood problems.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Do I need a referral from my GP?</h2>
		<p class="answers">No. A formal referral from your GP is not necessary just as you do not need a doctor’s referral to consult a dentist. The majority of our osteopathic patients self-refer. However, more and more GPs are referring patients to osteopaths. <br><br> The practice has a good relationship with local members of the medical profession and we will be happy to work with your doctor to establish the best course of action, though it is not necessary for your doctor to be informed that you are attending.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Will treatment be covered by my insurance?</h2>
		<p class="answers">If you require treatment covered by Health Insurance, a GP referral may be necessary, so please check this with your insurance company.  We are registered with all major insurance companies. We operate a system whereby payment follows each session and we will provide you with a receipt in order that your insurance company can reimburse you for the cost. <br><br>Since 1974 the General Medical Council has permitted doctors to refer patients to practitioners outside the medical profession provided that they retain ultimate responsibility and have confidence in the practitioner’s competence.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">What is Cranial Osteopathy?</h2>
		<p class="answers">Cranial Osteopathy is a refined and subtle type of osteopathic treatment that uses very gentle manipulative pressure to encourage the release of stresses throughout the body, including the head. It is extremely effective in treating a wide range of conditions in people of all ages, from birth to old age.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">How can Osteopathy help children?</h2>

		<img src="images/wait.jpg" class="pic">

		<h2 class="subtitle">What can I expect from my first visit?</h2>
		<p class="answers">Consultation and discussion of your problem, examination, evaluation and diagnosis with an outline of treatment and/or referral. <br><br>
 		We can refer for other investigations; such as X-ray, MRI or to a GP, specialist or another appropriate practitioner. You will be expected to remove some clothing, so please come appropriately dressed.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">Do you have disabled access and parking?</h2>
		<p class="answers">Yes, we offer parking and we have disabled access with treatment rooms on the ground floor</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">How much does treatment cost?</h2>
		<p class="answers">Osteopathic treatment in this area is not yet available under the National Health Service. Fees vary between practitioners and from area to area. The osteopath will be pleased to tell you his scale of fees before you decide on a consultation.</p>
